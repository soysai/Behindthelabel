                    <div>In an increasingly interconnected world, few things transcend borders and cultures like food. From the moment we hold a product in our hands, the packaging speaks to us -- through its design, language, and the promises it makes about the contents inside. Food packaging, often overlooked as a mere wrapper or container, tells a much larger story about culture, globalization, and identity.</div><br> <div>This project is much more than an analysis of packaging; it’s an exploration of the stories we consume, the identities we project, and the shared experiences we create through something as simple—and as profound—as the food we buy and share. Through this lens, the world feels a little smaller, and our understanding of each other a little richer.</div> <br> <div>This is a platform to reconstruct the loss in community we often feel as immigrants. It's an initiative to put yourself in the unknown, take a chance and see where it goes.</div> <br>

                    <div>If you’re the child of immigrants, you may have endured a ‘lunchbox moment’ at school, when you would open your lunchbox in the cafeteria and other, whiter kids would judge the homemade meals your mom had made. You’d receive funny looks — maybe even an outright gag. They said your food was “weird” or “gross,” that it looked “like puke” or smelled “rotten.” And if lunch was a meal eaten with your hands, like <span class="roticurry" id="roticurry"> roti and curry </span>, you’d be stared at as an object of exotic fascination.</div><br> <div>It didn’t matter that it was your favourite dish or that it carried your mom’s love, worked into the dough or stirred into the soup late the previous night. Your lunch was just too different. You were just too different.
                    </div> <br> <div>The lunchbox moment is a real experience, and it’s common enough that people of colour can relate to each other through it. However, it never represents the full story of what food means to many racialized people.
                    </div> <br> <div>In an essay for Eater, food writer Jaya Saxena brilliantly exposes how the trope flattens the experiences of racialized students. It emphasizes a desire for whiteness over any more positive or nuanced emotions racialized people may experience as they interact with members of their own community.
                    </div> <div>It’s precisely this simplicity that makes the trope appealing to a white audience. It reduces our stories to a sense of loneliness, eliminating the complexity of the racism — and the complexity of the joy — that racialized people’s experience in relation to food.

                    <div>Making the lunchbox moment a universal shorthand for the experience of racialized people effectively ends the story of our childhoods with a painful moment. People of colour who’ve experienced lunchbox moments in childhood aren’t defined by them. They can come to celebrate and share their food later in life, in order to fully understand and embrace the otherness that inflicted them as children.</div>
